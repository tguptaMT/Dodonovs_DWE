##Dodonov's Distance weighted estimator in Visual Basic

This subroutine allows you to choose a column of numerical values in an opened excel workwook, estimates Dodonov's distance-weighted mean, SD and 95% confidence intervals for selected data and spits out those values at specified location within the workbook. The distance weighted estimates are based on following reference: "Robust measures of central tendency: weighting as a possible alternative to trimming in response-time data analysis, Yury S. Dodonov, Yulia A. Dodonova (Psikhologicheskie Issledovaniya. ISSN 2075-7999)"
